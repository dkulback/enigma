# Enigma

Enigma is a Turing Mod 1 Final Project with the purpose to capstone what students have learned for module 1. It encapsulates; OOP, algorithmic strategies, data structures basic FILE/IO and more.

Enigma is based on the Caesar cipher where the user can encrypt a message with a key and date that will shift the letters of their message accordingly. The receiver then can decrypt the code using the key and date the message was sent using.
